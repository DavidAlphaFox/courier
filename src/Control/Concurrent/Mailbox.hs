-- Portability :  non-portable (uses STM)
--
-- A 'Mailbox' is a drop-in replacement for 'TQueue' in "Control.Concurrent.STM", except that
-- it also supports selective out of order message reception: that is, it allows the caller
-- to dequeue the first message among the messages available in the queue that matches
-- a supplied test function, or block if no such match is possible with the messages currently
-- in the queue.
--
-- As 'Mailbox' implements the same basic @read / write / peek@ group of functions as a 'TQueue',
-- it offers a superset of 'TQueue' functionality by extending it with the @find / select / handle@
-- groups of functions.  Thus, applications can safely use 'Mailbox'es in place of 'TQueue's,
-- but choose when to take the slight extra overhead of 'Mailbox' functionality.
--
-- Because message selection in worst case requires fully traversing all messages in the queue,
-- application designers are encouraged to understand this aspect when choosing to use 'Mailbox'es
-- in their designs, or when using the additional features of 'Mailbox'es beyond that of 'TQueue's.
-- Dispatching messages with a 'Mailbox' is analogous to using a @case@ expression (O(n)) to dispatch
-- messages to a handler function, except that new cases can be added or removed at any time.  In essence,
-- one can regard 'Mailbox'es as a useful means of creating an extensible message dispatch function.
-- If, however, if O(1) message dispatching time is necessary or desired, (using hashmaps, for example)
-- then 'Mailbox'es are not the correct choice.
--
-- Despite this extra cost, 'Mailbox'es offer advantages to designers:
--
-- * Implementation of Erlang-style message reception: as messages can be received
-- out of order, a mailbox is analogous to a process input queue in Erlang.
--
-- * Better composability: if applications must only dequeue messages in the order in which
-- they are queued (which is sufficient for many applications), then the main message
-- pump requires modification each time a new class of message must be handled. With
-- selective message reception, multiple concurrent message pumps are possible (with
-- a small performance impact), each processing the messages they expect and with no
-- need to be aware of other message pumps performing their own work on the same mailbox.
--
-- * Mixing synchronous and asynchronous programming styles: if restricted to in order message
-- delivery, an application must carefully construct all logic to avoid blocking its central message
-- loop. By supporting out of message delivery and multiple selective recipients, it becomes possible
-- to combine synchronous and asynchronous programming styles using the same 'Mailbox'.
--
-- Basic framework for 'Mailbox' brazenly copied from "Control.Concurrent.STM.TQueue".

  对Mailbox来说
  永远都是写入Mailbox的_write
  当读取的时候，优先读取Mailbox的_read
  如果_read的数据是空的，那么将_write读取出来，并进行翻转放入_read中
  这样会减少读取和写入的冲突
